== Introduction

The Jakarta Wombat specification defines an API for managing wombats,
as described by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat[Wikipedia]:

Wombats are short-legged, muscular quadrupedal marsupials that are
native to Australia. They are about 1 m (40 in) in length with small,
stubby tails. There are three extant species and they are all members
of the family Vombatidae. They are adaptable and habitat tolerant, and
are found in forested, mountainous, and heathland areas of
south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania, as well as an isolated
patch of about 300 ha (740 acres) in Epping Forest National Park in
central Queensland.
